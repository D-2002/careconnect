Project Name: Care Connect

OVERVIEW

Our project aims to develop a decentralized crowdfunding platform specifically designed for healthcare and disaster relief initiatives. Leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparent and secure transactions while eliminating third-party intermediaries. Additionally, our platform incorporates a community-driven validation model to assess the legitimacy of organizations seeking funding.

In summary, we ensure 3 features lacking from most crowdfunding sites in today's date: TRANSPARENCY, LEGITIMACY AND IMMUTABILITY

FEATURES
